# Architecture Rules

- Use React components to build UI instead of injecting HTML or CSS directly into the page.
- Avoid inline styles; use Tailwind CSS and daisyUI classes through JSX.
- Encapsulate logic and presentation cleanly using hooks and component layers.
- Keep rendering and state logic separate from content scraping or AI inference layers.
