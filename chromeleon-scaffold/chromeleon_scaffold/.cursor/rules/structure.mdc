# Project Structure Rules

- Enforce clear separation of layers:
  - `background/`: Extension lifecycle and event management
  - `content/`: Injected UI and DOM interaction logic
  - `components/`: React UI components
  - `utils/`: Shared utility logic, including AI interfacing
- Avoid inline DOM manipulation outside React entry points
